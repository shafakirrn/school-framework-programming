- **Video 9 (Eloquent ORM and Post Model)**

  Here we learn about _Eloquent_, an object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes it enjoyable to interact with your database (Laravel Documentation). We can change the Model News in a proper way, by using _Route Model Binding_ that help us to send all model's data which will be match with the `id`. Before using the `create` method, we need to choose either `fillable` or `guarded` property on our model class. `fillable` is used to specify fields which are to be mass assignable, while `guarded` is the reverse of `fillable`, that specify fields which are not mass assignable. Then, we canuse `tinker` to help us in database modification

    - `php artisan tinker` that shows all data in our `Post` Model
